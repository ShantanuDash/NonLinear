# Some Resources for staring with neural networks and reservoir computing - [Shantanu Dash](https://shantanu.rocks)
## Neural Networks
- [Neural Networks from scratch- only first two posts are enough for starting of](https://victorzhou.com/series/neural-networks-from-scratch/)
- Could optionally study about scikit-learn, tensorflow in brief and get a feel of it

## Reservoir Computing
